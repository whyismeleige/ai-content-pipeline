"I work at a 5-star hotel and here's what we never tell the guests. Behind the gleaming marble floors and impeccable service, our housekeeping team is paid an hourly wage that allows them to make barely enough to cover their rent. They're forced to work long hours without overtime pay, all while maintaining the illusion of luxury.

But that's not the worst part. What we don't tell you about the amenities is that many of our rooms are infested with bed bugs and dust mites. We've caught multiple staff members struggling with allergies and skin conditions due to the hotel's lax pest control measures.

And when guests complain, we often silence them by offering a "complimentary" upgrade to a room on the other side of the building – where the problems are even more severe. It's a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where our staff is treated as disposable and our guests are kept in the dark.

I'm speaking out because it's time someone exposed the truth behind the luxury facade. We're not just hotel workers – we're human beings deserving of respect and fair treatment."
